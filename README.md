# WhiteBox-web
Landing page for white box. All of the relevent code is in the CODE folder, pretty much everything else is just setup.



# How can I view/run this myself?
If you've got git and npm installed, then just run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jeff-hykin/WhiteBox-web
cd WhiteBox-web
npm install -g parcel-bundler
parcel index.pug
```
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:1234
